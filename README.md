# EvilBunny Discord Bot 🐰

Welcome to the repository for **EvilBunny**, a robust and versatile Discord bot developed using the Serenity library in Rust. EvilBunny leverages an advanced command framework for the efficient creation and management of both standard and slash commands.

## 🌟 Features

- **Configurable:** The bot token is sourced from an environment variable, facilitating easy configuration and management of the bot's settings.
- **Built with Serenity:** EvilBunny is constructed using the widely-used and well-documented Serenity library in Rust, ensuring reliability and user-friendly operation.
- **Versioning:** There are two versions of EvilBunny available. The stable version is named "EvilBunny", and the development version is named "Red". This distinction allows users to select the version that best fits their requirements.

## 📦 System Dependencies

This package depends on `libavutil`. Make sure to install it on your system before building the project. In Fedora, you can install it by installing the `ffmpeg-devel` package from the RPMFusion repository.

## 🚀 Usage

To use EvilBunny, clone this repository and install the necessary Rust packages. Set your bot token in the `.env` file. Start the bot and use the `help` command to view the list of available commands. For detailed information about a specific command, use the `help [command]` command.
